            I identify with  mockingbirds. These birds mimicking the songs of
            other birds. As someone coming from Cuba -where we speak Spanish-
            living in the US and having to speak another language sometimes
            reminds me of this bird.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself very curious, too. I have a constant need for learning
            new stuff -like coding languages, for instance- and keeping myself busy
            developing my skills and acquiring new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am very excited to announce that I am part at the Epicodus
            boot-camp! I decided I wanted to become a web developer very
            recently. I have self-taught web coding during lock-down. There is
            where I discovered for the first time the the great possibilities
            the web had to offer to those of us with the interest and desire to
            discover its secrets.
